# swiftyAsyncImageView

This is a very simple swift asyncimageview, that download the imagev and store in documents folder. 
Next time, it won't download the file again but load from the documents directory.


Note:
As of now, there is no way to stop a async call we have already made. So you are using up your bandwidth. 
Also make sure you clear the documents folder once in a while.
